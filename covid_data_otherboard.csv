			I’ll use the same argument but from the other side. Humanity has been here for thousands of years; through plagues, blights, famine, ecological catastrophes...you name it and we’re still here. Most of those things happened well before there was a global economy to consider. So if we look at it from a black and white stand point us waiting a month to let things settle will have zero impact on humanities overall survivability. The only difference is when we talk about The Plague or any other threatening event it’s rather foreign and doesn’t involve us. The word quarantine came about during the plague. As a measure of safety it’s what they did. If we talk about the Great Depression we do in fact know mortality rate as a whole did not increase. People didn’t starve to death though times were tough. For years. Suicide rates did increase but there wasn’t some mass plummet in life. And that’s really all we can compare it too. The Great Recession also didn’t cause an increase in mortality. So when there is a comparison about “what could possibly happen based off history” then it tells us no matter what we do humanity will go on. This just affects us and all these “altruist” notions of the economy and “think of the grandkids’ future!” come off as putting money before life. I’m also fairly certain when anyone says “many will die” they aren’t counting themselves or their immediate family in that tally. And as I asked in another post, I’m also certain those championing an immediate return to normalcy at the risk of others wouldn’t forgo treatment as to not tax an already overburden healthcare system should they themselves wind up on the receiving end of the unlucky stick. I’d also wager if they lost a child or loved one “yeah some people will have to die” won’t be the soothing and comforting words of choice at the wake. “Johnny was a great son. But many people had to die for the sake of our economy!” just doesn’t roll off the tongue smoothly. 
 


	So, as far as humanity is concerned, us waiting a month will literally be an insignificant blip when it’s all said and done. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

			Those people are literally telling people not to be out there. The people you are purporting to support are saying if you’d like to support them and their efforts to keep people alive then do the opposite of what you’re proposing. There’s a whole social media campaign by medical staff encouraging people to not be out if they can avoid it.  
	 
 


	And I’m trying to make it clear that I am strongly in favor of trying get the economy restarted and for people to be back at work. Even if for my own selfish reasons. I understand that need. I just want us to be smart about it.
 


	If you got sick would you seek medical help or languish at home and hope you recovered?
 


	Hopefully I get this edit in: In some strange way I do actually appreciate your take on walking the walk.

			In 1946 congress removed the excessive profit tax, cut corporate tax rates, and cut top income tax rates. Those measures surely can’t go unnoticed or overlooked.

			Please educate me then. Seriously, tell me how a war and a war funds would lead to an economic boom when a lot of the jobs during that time would’ve been for the war effort. There was definitely a drop in unemployment but the economic boom came after the war ended. So we traded unemployment for debt, right? Literal fact: the national debt went from  49 billion at the start of the war to ~260billion at the end.

			Nothing like a good! I’m being sarcastic of course. The ending of the war is probably better attributed to the ending of the Great Depression. Government spending during didn’t really contribute or doesn’t equal consumer spending. And the government’s spending during that time was simply added to the GDP. Increased taxes and borrowing from the government to fund a war effort doesn’t necessarily stimulate the economy.

			I understand things have to restart. I do. It’s not feasible to go 18 months or even another 6 months for that matter. I definitely understand that. I was just saying if I’m expected to go back out there for the sake of the economy at the behest of those opting to stay home and safe then they too should just come on out and join the fun. “Many will die” feels a lot different when It’s a possibility you and your loved ones might be part of those figures.  
	 
 


	Since the Great Depression is often the comparison it took about a decade if I remember correctly for things to turn around with the New Deal being a major catalyst. I’m the grandson of depression era grandparents. The idea that “we have to do this for future of our grandkids” feels a little anemic when we’re right back where they started (if that’s the economic comparison). And even more frustrating when people are eager to get back to normal when clearly what was normal doesn’t necessarily work when scrutinized or put to the test. Oh, and there’s 0 plan for those us going back out there to test the waters.

			Imma need some of you “at risk” people so keen on sending everyone else out restart the economy to go ahead and join the parade. 
	 
 


	How about this; since we know there will be plenty of jobs and people maybe cautious in taking the most risky ones like grocery store workers, malls, service industry, and really anything else that would expose you to others at high frequency you guys take. You forgo your social security, Medicare or Medicaid (whichever you old people get), special shopping hours, and whatever other senior discounts and benefits currently receive. Employers only have to provide basic insurance if they have so many employees so there’s no guarantee there but you can always purchase your own on the free market. Or don’t since it’s not required. 
 


	If you have adult children you should also move in with them. As many have said we’re all likely going to get it (might as well expose them early and quickly!) and if they’re young and have young kids they’re likely not going to die. But even if they do die, as sad as that maybe, I’m reminded of the mantra “some people will in fact die.” Now if you should get sick and need hospitalization you will be required to figure out how you’re going to pay for that care. And how you will maintain your job during that absence.  If you should pass while performing an act for the greater good that is the economy and future of your children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren then know they will receive a plaque with your name on it and a ridiculously large hospital bill. Someone has to pay that after all. But do not fret! Your sacrifice in restarting the economy will never be forgotten.

			I’m employed and made it through a round of layoffs going on at this very moment. I also have other means of income so my position And view is heavily skewed. I can say we should wait it out a little longer because I’m doing ok; however, it would be nice to get back to some semblance of normalcy because I know people are in fact struggling. I can say wait it out because I’m speaking from a place of privilege.  
	 
 


	The biggest problem I see in lifting the ban is there hasn’t been anything said or put in place if someone gets seriously sick. Companies aren’t being told to provide additional and adequate paid sick leave. “if you’re sick stay home” literally isn’t an option for a lot of people.  Insurance companies aren’t giving passes should you wind up in the hospital or need any other specialized care. There’s zero for lost wages or automatic life insurance policies should the worst happen. Households can also be mixed with a combination of healthy and vulnerable people. What do we do for them?  Additionally the argument that since I’m young and healthy so maybe won’t suffer too bad doesn’t hold weight. I’m not trying to be the odd man out. Nor do I want me friends to be that person either.  
	 
 


	In short it’s a mess that’s going to require some forward thinking that changes the status quo.

Adkins rushed through the intense enemy fire to man a mortar position to repel the attack, his Medal of Honor citation says.

			It's not an easy place for anybody to be in right now. There are plenty of us who are not providers that have already been laid off and have no means of income. Individuals with no savings and/or credit who are living paycheck to paycheck are going to feel this first and most certainly the hardest.
 


	What would be most devastating is if the unregulated derivatives markets fail. Then, the BIG BOYS in government would most certainly provide bailouts for the big corporations and investors who have been betting on futures.  Yes, every American will likely get a couple of checks for $1200 bucks, but the amount of money that would go into the pockets of already wealthy speculators will be obscene.

			Honestly, if I'm asked to download an app for GPS tracking of my movement, I'm fine with it, if it helps do contact tracing as the world starts to open back up.  It can be turned off, temporarily, as well.

That's my take - the phone companies and 3rd parties already know tons about me, so it's not that big of deal to me.  Then again, I'm in healthcare, and I see the benefit.

			I’ll use the same argument but from the other side. Humanity has been here for thousands of years; through plagues, blights, famine, ecological catastrophes...you name it and we’re still here. Most of those things happened well before there was a global economy to consider. So if we look at it from a black and white stand point us waiting a month to let things settle will have zero impact on humanities overall survivability. The only difference is when we talk about The Plague or any other threatening event it’s rather foreign and doesn’t involve us. The word quarantine came about during the plague. As a measure of safety it’s what they did. If we talk about the Great Depression we do in fact know mortality rate as a whole did not increase. People didn’t starve to death though times were tough. For years. Suicide rates did increase but there wasn’t some mass plummet in life. And that’s really all we can compare it too. The Great Recession also didn’t cause an increase in mortality. So when there is a comparison about “what could possibly happen based off history” then it tells us no matter what we do humanity will go on. This just affects us and all these “altruist” notions of the economy and “think of the grandkids’ future!” come off as putting money before life. I’m also fairly certain when anyone says “many will die” they aren’t counting themselves or their immediate family in that tally. And as I asked in another post, I’m also certain those championing an immediate return to normalcy at the risk of others wouldn’t forgo treatment as to not tax an already overburden healthcare system should they themselves wind up on the receiving end of the unlucky stick. I’d also wager if they lost a child or loved one “yeah some people will have to die” won’t be the soothing and comforting words of choice at the wake. “Johnny was a great son. But many people had to die for the sake of our economy!” just doesn’t roll off the tongue smoothly. 
 


	So, as far as humanity is concerned, us waiting a month will literally be an insignificant blip when it’s all said and done. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

			Those people are literally telling people not to be out there. The people you are purporting to support are saying if you’d like to support them and their efforts to keep people alive then do the opposite of what you’re proposing. There’s a whole social media campaign by medical staff encouraging people to not be out if they can avoid it.  
	 
 


	And I’m trying to make it clear that I am strongly in favor of trying get the economy restarted and for people to be back at work. Even if for my own selfish reasons. I understand that need. I just want us to be smart about it.

			Please educate me then. Seriously, tell me how a war and a war funds would lead to an economic boom when a lot of the jobs during that time would’ve been for the war effort. There was definitely a drop in unemployment but the economic boom came after the war ended. So we traded unemployment for debt, right? Literal fact: the national debt went from  49 billion at the start of the war to ~260billion at the end.

			Nothing like a good! I’m being sarcastic of course. The ending of the war is probably better attributed to the ending of the Great Depression. Government spending during didn’t really contribute or doesn’t equal consumer spending. And the government’s spending during that time was simply added to the GDP. Increased taxes and borrowing from the government to fund a war effort doesn’t necessarily stimulate the economy.

			I understand things have to restart. I do. It’s not feasible to go 18 months or even another 6 months for that matter. I definitely understand that. I was just saying if I’m expected to go back out there for the sake of the economy at the behest of those opting to stay home and safe then they too should just come on out and join the fun. “Many will die” feels a lot different when It’s a possibility you and your loved ones might be part of those figures.  
	 
 


	Since the Great Depression is often the comparison it took about a decade if I remember correctly for things to turn around with the New Deal being a major catalyst. I’m the grandson of depression era grandparents. The idea that “we have to do this for future of our grandkids” feels a little anemic when we’re right back where they started (if that’s the economic comparison). And even more frustrating when people are eager to get back to normal when clearly what was normal doesn’t necessarily work when scrutinized or put to the test. Oh, and there’s 0 plan for those us going back out there to test the waters.

			Imma need some of you “at risk” people so keen on sending everyone else out restart the economy to go ahead and join the parade. 
	 
 


	How about this; since we know there will be plenty of jobs and people maybe cautious in taking the most risky ones like grocery store workers, malls, service industry, and really anything else that would expose you to others at high frequency you guys take. You forgo your social security, Medicare or Medicaid (whichever you old people get), special shopping hours, and whatever other senior discounts and benefits currently receive. Employers only have to provide basic insurance if they have so many employees so there’s no guarantee there but you can always purchase your own on the free market. Or don’t since it’s not required. 
 


	If you have adult children you should also move in with them. As many have said we’re all likely going to get it (might as well expose them early and quickly!) and if they’re young and have young kids they’re likely not going to die. But even if they do die, as sad as that maybe, I’m reminded of the mantra “some people will in fact die.” Now if you should get sick and need hospitalization you will be required to figure out how you’re going to pay for that care. And how you will maintain your job during that absence.  If you should pass while performing an act for the greater good that is the economy and future of your children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren then know they will receive a plaque with your name on it and a ridiculously large hospital bill. Someone has to pay that after all. But do not fret! Your sacrifice in restarting the economy will never be forgotten.

			I’m employed and made it through a round of layoffs going on at this very moment. I also have other means of income so my position And view is heavily skewed. I can say we should wait it out a little longer because I’m doing ok; however, it would be nice to get back to some semblance of normalcy because I know people are in fact struggling. I can say wait it out because I’m speaking from a place of privilege.  
	 
 


	The biggest problem I see in lifting the ban is there hasn’t been anything said or put in place if someone gets seriously sick. Companies aren’t being told to provide additional and adequate paid sick leave. “if you’re sick stay home” literally isn’t an option for a lot of people.  Insurance companies aren’t giving passes should you wind up in the hospital or need any other specialized care. There’s zero for lost wages or automatic life insurance policies should the worst happen. Households can also be mixed with a combination of healthy and vulnerable people. What do we do for them?  Additionally the argument that since I’m young and healthy so maybe won’t suffer too bad doesn’t hold weight. I’m not trying to be the odd man out. Nor do I want me friends to be that person either.  
	 
 


	In short it’s a mess that’s going to require some forward thinking that changes the status quo.

	""And my only response to that is, 'I'm sorry.' "" ~ Stephen King
 


	On how writing provides an escape from reality
 


	Twenty hours a day, I live in the same reality that everybody else lives in. But for four hours a day, things change. And if you ever asked me how that happens or why it happens, I'd have to tell you it's as much a mystery to me as it is to anybody else. ... ~ Stephen King

			It's Important to know exactly what a provider's reference sharing policy is BEFORE you book the appt. Especially If you're a gent that doesn't want to use your real world info, and prefer the reference friendly network. It's good to have a few badass ladies you know who will always go above and beyond to give you a reference. The sharing is caring ladies ❤

			Very common. I reach out to p411 okays all over the country, and vice versa.

			Those bios are extremely helpful, and I haven't met a gent yet where his bio didn't match my experience with him. I'm sure that does happen though.

			Many providers verify their P411 Okays and TOB references, and ask for additional information that will help them determine if they're a good fit with a client. 
 


	Very similar to clients back channeling regarding a provider even though they have a list of reviews.

			If I were a client, and a provider refused to return reference requests for me, I would remove my reviews for them. Go to their websites and check their ""protocols"" and use that as your guide for how long you'll keep your review up for them. Their logic and reasoning for references should apply to reviews as well. Fair is fair.

			You have the luxury of doing this because of your age and any health issues that leave you compromised. If you were in your 20s, 30s, or 40s and healthy and not retired, you'd be making the same tough decisions as the rest of us
 


	You are callus about other people's lives or loss of life of those that are not as fortunate as you, because you choose to be. There are other soldiers who choose not to be.

			Exactly. It's easy for you to type out your responses so emphatically, because you are elderly, retired and protected during the pandemic, so you don't have to make the tough decisions, and take the risks that many of us and our families do. 
 


	You have the luxury of saying... we can't save everyone! And that's a decision you'll have to make. Your risks, not mine. 
 


	I will say this, I am glad people like you are protected, and I'd much rather take the risks instead of you, and my mom and aunts and uncles and my elderly and compromised friends. I would rather take the risks for all of my adult children and many other close family and friends who aren't protected, but we will repoen soon, and they will have to go back like everyone else, and be included in the case numbers. Hopefully not death numbers. 🙏🙏🙏
 


	I will also say this, if I lose one of my children, I won't give af about the economy. I'll lose my shit. I'm not as strong as some of you. I'll have fucking breakdown.

			I would never want anything to happen to you or anybody that's at risk.  I highlighted your quote to put emphasis on when you say we can't save everyone with an exclamation point! Fortunately for you, you won't be at risk of being one of the everyone's! You will be protected.

	I have 3 jobs and all of them it's impossible to practice social distancing, but 2 of them I can wear a mask and gloves. I'm still struggling with what to do, and when to put an ad up again.

	Medal of Honor recipient Bennie Adkins age 86, heroically fighting off enemies and saving wounded soldiers in Vietnam, died April 17 from complications caused by the coronavirus.
 


	Adkins while being wounded 18 times and helping fellow soldiers to safety. For those acts received the Medal of Honor in 2014.
 


	Early on the morning of March 9, 1966, hundreds of North Vietnamese descended on their camp, Camp A Shau, which was also pounded with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Adkins rushed through the intense enemy fire to man a mortar position to repel the attack, his Medal of Honor citation says. Despite being wounded by shrapnel, Adkins ran through mortar fire to reach wounded soldiers and drag them to safety.....

			I’ll use the same argument but from the other side. Humanity has been here for thousands of years; through plagues, blights, famine, ecological catastrophes...you name it and we’re still here. Most of those things happened well before there was a global economy to consider. So if we look at it from a black and white stand point us waiting a month to let things settle will have zero impact on humanities overall survivability. The only difference is when we talk about The Plague or any other threatening event it’s rather foreign and doesn’t involve us. The word quarantine came about during the plague. As a measure of safety it’s what they did. If we talk about the Great Depression we do in fact know mortality rate as a whole did not increase. People didn’t starve to death though times were tough. For years. Suicide rates did increase but there wasn’t some mass plummet in life. And that’s really all we can compare it too. The Great Recession also didn’t cause an increase in mortality. So when there is a comparison about “what could possibly happen based off history” then it tells us no matter what we do humanity will go on. This just affects us and all these “altruist” notions of the economy and “think of the grandkids’ future!” come off as putting money before life. I’m also fairly certain when anyone says “many will die” they aren’t counting themselves or their immediate family in that tally. And as I asked in another post, I’m also certain those championing an immediate return to normalcy at the risk of others wouldn’t forgo treatment as to not tax an already overburden healthcare system should they themselves wind up on the receiving end of the unlucky stick. I’d also wager if they lost a child or loved one “yeah some people will have to die” won’t be the soothing and comforting words of choice at the wake. “Johnny was a great son. But many people had to die for the sake of our economy!” just doesn’t roll off the tongue smoothly. 
 


	So, as far as humanity is concerned, us waiting a month will literally be an insignificant blip when it’s all said and done. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

			Those people are literally telling people not to be out there. The people you are purporting to support are saying if you’d like to support them and their efforts to keep people alive then do the opposite of what you’re proposing. There’s a whole social media campaign by medical staff encouraging people to not be out if they can avoid it.  
	 
 


	And I’m trying to make it clear that I am strongly in favor of trying get the economy restarted and for people to be back at work. Even if for my own selfish reasons. I understand that need. I just want us to be smart about it.
 


	If you got sick would you seek medical help or languish at home and hope you recovered?

			Please educate me then. Seriously, tell me how a war and a war funds would lead to an economic boom when a lot of the jobs during that time would’ve been for the war effort. There was definitely a drop in unemployment but the economic boom came after the war ended. So we traded unemployment for debt, right? Literal fact: the national debt went from  49 billion at the start of the war to ~260billion at the end.

			Nothing like a good! I’m being sarcastic of course. The ending of the war is probably better attributed to the ending of the Great Depression. Government spending during didn’t really contribute or doesn’t equal consumer spending. And the government’s spending during that time was simply added to the GDP. Increased taxes and borrowing from the government to fund a war effort doesn’t necessarily stimulate the economy.

			I understand things have to restart. I do. It’s not feasible to go 18 months or even another 6 months for that matter. I definitely understand that. I was just saying if I’m expected to go back out there for the sake of the economy at the behest of those opting to stay home and safe then they too should just come on out and join the fun. “Many will die” feels a lot different when It’s a possibility you and your loved ones might be part of those figures.  
	 
 


	Since the Great Depression is often the comparison it took about a decade if I remember correctly for things to turn around with the New Deal being a major catalyst. I’m the grandson of depression era grandparents. The idea that “we have to do this for future of our grandkids” feels a little anemic when we’re right back where they started (if that’s the economic comparison). And even more frustrating when people are eager to get back to normal when clearly what was normal doesn’t necessarily work when scrutinized or put to the test. Oh, and there’s 0 plan for those us going back out there to test the waters.

			Imma need some of you “at risk” people so keen on sending everyone else out restart the economy to go ahead and join the parade. 
	 
 


	How about this; since we know there will be plenty of jobs and people maybe cautious in taking the most risky ones like grocery store workers, malls, service industry, and really anything else that would expose you to others at high frequency you guys take. You forgo your social security, Medicare or Medicaid (whichever you old people get), special shopping hours, and whatever other senior discounts and benefits currently receive. Employers only have to provide basic insurance if they have so many employees so there’s no guarantee there but you can always purchase your own on the free market. Or don’t since it’s not required. 
 


	If you have adult children you should also move in with them. As many have said we’re all likely going to get it (might as well expose them early and quickly!) and if they’re young and have young kids they’re likely not going to die. But even if they do die, as sad as that maybe, I’m reminded of the mantra “some people will in fact die.” Now if you should get sick and need hospitalization you will be required to figure out how you’re going to pay for that care. And how you will maintain your job during that absence.  If you should pass while performing an act for the greater good that is the economy and future of your children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren then know they will receive a plaque with your name on it and a ridiculously large hospital bill. Someone has to pay that after all. But do not fret! Your sacrifice in restarting the economy will never be forgotten.

			I’m employed and made it through a round of layoffs going on at this very moment. I also have other means of income so my position And view is heavily skewed. I can say we should wait it out a little longer because I’m doing ok; however, it would be nice to get back to some semblance of normalcy because I know people are in fact struggling. I can say wait it out because I’m speaking from a place of privilege.  
	 
 


	The biggest problem I see in lifting the ban is there hasn’t been anything said or put in place if someone gets seriously sick. Companies aren’t being told to provide additional and adequate paid sick leave. “if you’re sick stay home” literally isn’t an option for a lot of people.  Insurance companies aren’t giving passes should you wind up in the hospital or need any other specialized care. There’s zero for lost wages or automatic life insurance policies should the worst happen. Households can also be mixed with a combination of healthy and vulnerable people. What do we do for them?  Additionally the argument that since I’m young and healthy so maybe won’t suffer too bad doesn’t hold weight. I’m not trying to be the odd man out. Nor do I want me friends to be that person either.  
	 
 


	In short it’s a mess that’s going to require some forward thinking that changes the status quo.

			Honestly, if I'm asked to download an app for GPS tracking of my movement, I'm fine with it, if it helps do contact tracing as the world starts to open back up.  It can be turned off, temporarily, as well.    
	This will be an important tool to help us trace and contact people who are exposed to known cases.  That's my take - the phone companies and 3rd parties already know tons about me, so it's not that big of deal to me.  Then again, I'm in healthcare, and I see the benefit.  Most people would faint if they knew just how much of our info is already out there, anyway.  If I need to pop offline for an hour, I can turn my phone off.

			I’ll use the same argument but from the other side. Humanity has been here for thousands of years; through plagues, blights, famine, ecological catastrophes...you name it and we’re still here. Most of those things happened well before there was a global economy to consider. So if we look at it from a black and white stand point us waiting a month to let things settle will have zero impact on humanities overall survivability. The only difference is when we talk about The Plague or any other threatening event it’s rather foreign and doesn’t involve us. The word quarantine came about during the plague. As a measure of safety it’s what they did. If we talk about the Great Depression we do in fact know mortality rate as a whole did not increase. People didn’t starve to death though times were tough. For years. Suicide rates did increase but there wasn’t some mass plummet in life. And that’s really all we can compare it too. The Great Recession also didn’t cause an increase in mortality. So when there is a comparison about “what could possibly happen based off history” then it tells us no matter what we do humanity will go on. This just affects us and all these “altruist” notions of the economy and “think of the grandkids’ future!” come off as putting money before life. I’m also fairly certain when anyone says “many will die” they aren’t counting themselves or their immediate family in that tally. And as I asked in another post, I’m also certain those championing an immediate return to normalcy at the risk of others wouldn’t forgo treatment as to not tax an already overburden healthcare system should they themselves wind up on the receiving end of the unlucky stick. I’d also wager if they lost a child or loved one “yeah some people will have to die” won’t be the soothing and comforting words of choice at the wake. “Johnny was a great son. But many people had to die for the sake of our economy!” just doesn’t roll off the tongue smoothly. 
 


	So, as far as humanity is concerned, us waiting a month will literally be an insignificant blip when it’s all said and done. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

			Those people are literally telling people not to be out there. The people you are purporting to support are saying if you’d like to support them and their efforts to keep people alive then do the opposite of what you’re proposing. There’s a whole social media campaign by medical staff encouraging people to not be out if they can avoid it.  
	 
 


	And I’m trying to make it clear that I am strongly in favor of trying get the economy restarted and for people to be back at work. Even if for my own selfish reasons. I understand that need. I just want us to be smart about it.
 


	If you got sick would you seek medical help or languish at home and hope you recovered?

			Please educate me then. Seriously, tell me how a war and a war funds would lead to an economic boom when a lot of the jobs during that time would’ve been for the war effort. There was definitely a drop in unemployment but the economic boom came after the war ended. So we traded unemployment for debt, right? Literal fact: the national debt went from  49 billion at the start of the war to ~260billion at the end.

			Nothing like a good! I’m being sarcastic of course. The ending of the war is probably better attributed to the ending of the Great Depression. Government spending during didn’t really contribute or doesn’t equal consumer spending. And the government’s spending during that time was simply added to the GDP. Increased taxes and borrowing from the government to fund a war effort doesn’t necessarily stimulate the economy.

			I understand things have to restart. I do. It’s not feasible to go 18 months or even another 6 months for that matter. I definitely understand that. I was just saying if I’m expected to go back out there for the sake of the economy at the behest of those opting to stay home and safe then they too should just come on out and join the fun. “Many will die” feels a lot different when It’s a possibility you and your loved ones might be part of those figures.  
	 
 


	Since the Great Depression is often the comparison it took about a decade if I remember correctly for things to turn around with the New Deal being a major catalyst. I’m the grandson of depression era grandparents. The idea that “we have to do this for future of our grandkids” feels a little anemic when we’re right back where they started (if that’s the economic comparison). And even more frustrating when people are eager to get back to normal when clearly what was normal doesn’t necessarily work when scrutinized or put to the test. Oh, and there’s 0 plan for those us going back out there to test the waters.

			Imma need some of you “at risk” people so keen on sending everyone else out restart the economy to go ahead and join the parade. 
	 
 


	How about this; since we know there will be plenty of jobs and people maybe cautious in taking the most risky ones like grocery store workers, malls, service industry, and really anything else that would expose you to others at high frequency you guys take. You forgo your social security, Medicare or Medicaid (whichever you old people get), special shopping hours, and whatever other senior discounts and benefits currently receive. Employers only have to provide basic insurance if they have so many employees so there’s no guarantee there but you can always purchase your own on the free market. Or don’t since it’s not required. 
 


	If you have adult children you should also move in with them. As many have said we’re all likely going to get it (might as well expose them early and quickly!) and if they’re young and have young kids they’re likely not going to die. But even if they do die, as sad as that maybe, I’m reminded of the mantra “some people will in fact die.” Now if you should get sick and need hospitalization you will be required to figure out how you’re going to pay for that care. And how you will maintain your job during that absence.  If you should pass while performing an act for the greater good that is the economy and future of your children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren then know they will receive a plaque with your name on it and a ridiculously large hospital bill. Someone has to pay that after all. But do not fret! Your sacrifice in restarting the economy will never be forgotten.

			I’m employed and made it through a round of layoffs going on at this very moment. I also have other means of income so my position And view is heavily skewed. I can say we should wait it out a little longer because I’m doing ok; however, it would be nice to get back to some semblance of normalcy because I know people are in fact struggling. I can say wait it out because I’m speaking from a place of privilege.  
	 
 


	The biggest problem I see in lifting the ban is there hasn’t been anything said or put in place if someone gets seriously sick. Companies aren’t being told to provide additional and adequate paid sick leave. “if you’re sick stay home” literally isn’t an option for a lot of people.  Insurance companies aren’t giving passes should you wind up in the hospital or need any other specialized care. There’s zero for lost wages or automatic life insurance policies should the worst happen. Households can also be mixed with a combination of healthy and vulnerable people. What do we do for them?  Additionally the argument that since I’m young and healthy so maybe won’t suffer too bad doesn’t hold weight. I’m not trying to be the odd man out. Nor do I want me friends to be that person either.  
	 
 


	In short it’s a mess that’s going to require some forward thinking that changes the status quo.

			If I were a client, and a provider refused to return reference requests for me, I would remove my reviews for them. Go to their websites and check their ""protocols"" and use that as your guide for how long you'll keep your review up for them. Their logic and reasoning for references should apply to reviews as well. Fair is fair.

			Exactly. It's easy for you to type out your responses so emphatically, because you are elderly, retired and protected during the pandemic, so you don't have to make the tough decisions, and take the risks that many of us and our families do. 
 


	You have the luxury of saying... we can't save everyone! And that's a decision you'll have to make. Your risks, not mine. 
 


	I will say this, I am glad people like you are protected, and I'd much rather take the risks instead of you, and my mom and aunts and uncles and my elderly and compromised friends. I would rather take the risks for all of my adult children and many other close family and friends who aren't protected, but we will repoen soon, and they will have to go back like everyone else, and be included in the case numbers. Hopefully not death numbers. 🙏🙏🙏
 


	I will also say this, if I lose one of my children, I won't give af about the economy. I'll lose my shit. I'm not as strong as some of you. I'll have fucking breakdown.

			I would never want anything to happen to you or anybody that's at risk.  I highlighted your quote to put emphasis on when you say we can't save everyone with an exclamation point! Fortunately for you, you won't be at risk of being one of the everyone's! You will be protected.

	Adkins while being wounded 18 times and helping fellow soldiers to safety. For those acts received the Medal of Honor in 2014.
 


	Early on the morning of March 9, 1966, hundreds of North Vietnamese descended on their camp, Camp A Shau, which was also pounded with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. Adkins rushed through the intense enemy fire to man a mortar position to repel the attack, his Medal of Honor citation says. Despite being wounded by shrapnel, Adkins ran through mortar fire to reach wounded soldiers and drag them to safety.....

			The last woman I saw, I mentioned that I thought her labia was sexy. Maybe an inch long or so. She replied she couldn’t wait to have them shortened. I was surprised. I think, behind innie nipples(or super long and with a small diameter) the labia is soooo erotic. I guess we all find fault with our bodies e.g. a little dunlap disease for me. But in my book, a little length on the labes with innie nipples; well it just don’t get better than that.

			It’s not just the grandpas in the race for president. All the political leadership in this country would fit right in at the local retirement home.
 


	Nancy Pelosi — 79, soon to be 80 in a couple of weeks.
 


	Mitch McConnell — 79.
 


	Average age of the Senate: 61 — One of the oldest in US History.
 


	Average age of the Supreme Court by the next election: 75.
 


	As someone who’s aging like fine wine, I think it’s short sighted to shove older people aside as relics. I generally like the generation of people in their 70s and 80s, But I still gotta say my father wasn’t the same man at 76 as he was at 66. I am not the guy I was at 25 or 35. 
 


	That the entire leadership class of this country could be wearing Depends under those nice suits speaks to a level of corruption and stagnation that’s part of our problems, no matter which side of the aisle you sit on.
 


	For comparison 
 


	Boris Johnson, UK Prime Minister: 55 
 


	Emmanuel Macron, French Prime Minister: 42 (he won the election at when he was 39)
 


	Katrin Jakobsdottir, Iceland, 43
 


	Sanna Marin, head of Finland (and pretty hot!) 34
 


	Whatever the problems those countries have — and they have some—at least they have flexible democracies with some fresh blood coming in.

			So far, Covid19 has killed about 3,000 globally. Certainly, more people will die — mostly the aged and those with compromised immune systems. For perspective,  80,000 Americans died last year from plain old influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
 


	Cars kill 36,000 people every year. And yet, we still drive on I25 or I70 in search of love or pussy. And that’s some dangerous action, right there. We all balance risk and reward according to what we want.
 


	Apart from a few seniors and hypochondriacs, I’m not sure there’ll be a big hit to the hobby. I could be wrong. But I also remember the SARS hysteria, and while that was a big deal in Asia, in Colorado...not so much. At all.
 


	Just be sure to wash your hands properly and stay healthy.

			Good questions. But it's considered bad form to ask about specific places on the public boards. That could attract the attention of law enforcement, and make those establishments the target of a bust.
 


	That said, they look like AMPs (asian massage parlors). Not all AMPs offer happy endings or, uh, total relaxation. (Which is why you probably asked, I know.) The subject of AMPs comes up frequently in the forums. You can probably find some good general information.  For massage parlors, Rubmaps.ch is a fee-based web site that offers consumer reviews. You can also find out if a place or a specific masseuse offers more than a standard rub. One poster here suggested getting a one-month membership to Rubmaps, researching all the places you'd be interested in visiting, then cancelling your membership.
 


	From what I've read:
 


	In general, you'll show up at the door. Either the mama-san or a masseuse will answer and ask you how long you want. You'll be led to a small room with a table. If you are asked if you've been there before, answer yes. It's a screener question to see if you might be interested in a hand job or whatever. Strip totally. That will also signal that you're open to Other Services. Put a tip on the table or in an obvious place. I don't really know how much to tip. It should be at least the door fee. If you tip double the door, that'll make the masseuse really happy, but it might be overkill. The masseuse will either pretend to give you a massage or actually give you one as you're face down. 
 


	She might initiate some more intimate moves. Then she'll ask you to flip over. You can indicate with a gesture or a look what you'd like. She may ask you in a whisper. She may upsell.
 


	Your experiences can vary widely, even in the same parlor. 
 


	According to knowledgable sources, the women are generally going to be middle aged. Sometimes, they will be middle aged and kind of cute or, even more exceptionally, youngish and cute, but it's almost never that you'll see a 7 or above (to be crass). It can happen, though. Some Korean places in Denver years ago had some attractive workers. But whoever it is, it will never be the cutie in the ad. Also, they don't speak English very well. 
 


	Also, keep in mind that many fine women offer FBSM in the Boulder area as independent workers.

			Thanks NoCoGeezer for bringing back a lot of good memories. You are correct, there was a rub n tug place on Canyon, just up from the courthouse. That made me a little nervous when I was exiting the place. I'd bet a lot of attorneys and their clients got some high quality stress relief there.
 


	There was indeed a brothel on north Broadway; it's now a Subaru repair shop. Very pretty ladies worked there as well.
 


	There used to be a hotel up on Broadway with hot tubs in the back of the rooms. It was real fun to drop some MDMA, look at the stars and hang with my girlfriend at the time, a stripper from the Colorado Mining Company. Pre AIDS. Pre herpes. You youngins have no idea. 
 


	I've been missing the Bustop for a while now. Construction has been underway for another architectural shit box where it used to be. I remember many fine nights there. The women were friendly and chatty, not totally about the hustle, and the drinks didn't cost much, for a strip club. Kinda like Friends, only with tits and ass. As another poster mentioned, you could get pretty lucky there. A lot of smart, adventurous women worked that stage.
 


	Nitro is way more upscale, and the girls work ya pretty hard. The entertainers are all quite beautiful, though.  Some guy a while back posted about getting lucky with a dancer, so maybe I've been there on off-nights. Also, having the dancers at eye-level feels weird to me. But, not at all the same vibe. Still, the owners played a great game getting that place in town.
 


	The last time I went to the Bustop, a hot entertainer seemed clearly, and so sincerely into me. That is, until I told her I didn't actually want to be her sugardaddy if that only meant holding her bags at the Cherry Creek Mall while she went shopping with my credit card. 
 


	Age. It happens.
 


	RIP Bustop.

			You might find this useful:
 


	http://www.internationalsexguide.nl/forum/forum.php
 


	I can't verify how solid the information is, since I don't travel internationally very often now. Still, you can get a pretty reasonable overview of the lay of the land.
 


	I'd have to echo the advice about either not hobbying in China at all or taking time and building a relationships with some gatekeepers over a long period. The few people I know who have worked in China and who hobby usually did the fun stuff in Hong Kong or Bangkok or other big Asian cities -- not in China itself. The government has been cracking down on so-called vice activities overall. 
 


	Personally, I've had very mixed experiences internationally -- great and horrific -- and those were in Western countries with tolerant regimes. Even then, the ripoffs and danger is high -- part of the excitement, but also awful when things don't work out (I'm still pissed about a 400 euro self-service job, and no, don't ask because I'm not going to say any more about that). (And I'm not actually a total idiot, believe it or not). These were in places with very low linguistic barriers -- nothing like dealing with ideograms and Mandarin. As you'd guess in a huge country emerging from poverty, there are a lot of very sharp hustlers. If it were utterly corrupt, like some other countries, you'd probably be better off, but China's in the worst between zone -- corrupt, but also with puritanical government crackdowns.
 


	You probably know this, too, but all of your Internet activity will be tracked, as well as your phone calls. You should assume any electronic activity you engage in will be documented by the authorities.
 


	Also, China's government is an absolutely evil totalitarian regime. If you want some confirmation, google ""Uigur"" or consider what's happening in Tibet, let alone the violence in Hong Kong. The people can be great, but the system is one of the very worst on the planet.

			Very cool link, thank you for posting. The women really own themselves in most of the images.
 


	I recently read Charlie Chaplin's memoir, and a criminal's memoirs, You Just Can't Win. Both of them described whole city blocks given over dozens of brothels, dance halls and bars in any sizable town around the turn of the last century. Charlie Chaplin said Denver's was particularly good, and Kansas City boasted a huge red light district larger than many small towns. It made the chief of police a wealthy fellow, with all the bribes and payoffs.
 


	Also cool about brothels: jazz.
 


	I've had good experiences in brothels, generally. In Denver, the old 'hot tub' places functioned as brothels. That was fun. Then the Caucasian massage parlors in the early 80s were effectively cat houses. Many of the workers were very attractive, and you could easily find someone you vibed with out of a crew of eight or so. 
 


	Supposedly, this is the menu of a New Orleans brothel. It looks authentic, anyway. If it is, it proves great grandpa was as kinky, or kinkier, than you.

			Glory holes were a relatively common part of gay subculture, pre-AIDS.
 


	Back in olden times, I was interested in the seedy side of life. On a trip to San Francisco back in the early 80s -- pre-AIDS and pre-herpes scare -- I ended up in a porno palace not far from the Tenderloin. It was a kind of Dave and Busters for sex -- arcades, girls behind glass, a strip club, a porn shop. Next door to the pleasure palace was an unmarked door.
 


	Had to be good, right?
 


	Behind the door was a junky gate keeper who took money for the glory hole in the back of the shop. He had to explain the concept to me. He also swore there were females on the other side of the holes.
 


	I bailed, for a lot of reasons -- the vibe there was heavy and dark, literally and figuratively. The idea of sticking Mr. Happy through a gap into a random person's mouth creeped me out -- even when I was a complete moron as well as high and horny.  I had visions of a legless, toothless hag working on my knob, and split.
 


	(Now, that was that place and that time.  If consenting people of whatever gender and however they identify want to indulge, go for it. It's not my business.)
 


	Not long afterwards, the topic came up again --- I used to work in a profession that's popular with gay men. They talked about glory holes (along with bath houses and the rest of it.) Glory holes were a fairly common thing, I guess, and available in some of the more radical gay clubs both informally and officially. (So this is hearsay, because I don't have any direct experience of this).
 


	He'd also confirmed what Mr 2 Big has noted -- they're always dudes on the other side. No matter what the advertising.
 


	I also remember those arcade booths with the holes punched in the walls. And, man, that's one thing I don't miss about those pre-VHS, pre-DVD days. It seemed as if every time I wanted to drop a slug to watch Seka get it on in 8mm technicolor glory  there was some guy in the next booth begging to blow me. (Again, consulting adults, blah blah, but .... thank you, nah.)

			Well, you could savor the delicious irony of someone complaining about how he or she is smarter than everyone else while expressing that thought in atrocious grammar and syntax.
 


	So, you could spend your extra time learning English grammar. Or, you could take an extra minute or so to look over what you've typed and correct obvious errors.
 


	Now, personally speaking, I am not so smart. In fact, I'm rather stupid. What I have noticed about people smarter than I am is that they are curious. About ideas, books, countries, cultures, history, science, mathematics and -- a lot of the time -- they are curious about other people. Even idiots like me.
 


	I'd suggest you put that high-powered intellect of yours into trying to understand the people you encounter. What motivates them? Why? What influences shaped their view of life? What is their view of life? It'd be actually worthwhile to understand what a moron -- like me, for example -- thinks about the nature and purpose of things, so you could avoid the same snares.
 


	The other thing I've noticed about the people that are much smarter than I, is that they're rarely bored. So you could learn a foreign language, study physics, volunteer for a literacy program to teach people who can't even read or write a few necessary skills. You could avoid humanity altogether and learn Classical Greek and Latin, look for a cure for cancer ... the possibilities are really endless.
 


	(And, just so you know, I generally dislike people who use errors in grammar and syntax of person who posted in a forum, but, in your case, I made an exception. And if English is a second language, then, bravo for learning it up to a certain point. But maybe you should learn it a tad bit better.)
 


	Good luck to you, and I hope you can bear that painful burden well as you go through the rest of your life.

			You should print out jj254-1's advice and follow it to the t. It's one of the best pieces of counsel I've read on this board.
 


	Turn the page. Move on. Get your shit together. Figure out what you want to rescue from the burning house that is your marriage.
 


	She betrayed you. No amount of counseling and conversations will change that. If you can accept that, forgive her completely,  and trust her from now on, then, yeah, sure. Stay with her. Let the Vatican know, too, because you will be in line for sainthood.
 


	You could try marital counseling. In my experience, that usually amounts to the female therapist and the female spouse agreeing that the male in the relationship has issues that he needs to work on. It's also expensive, takes a lot of time and work, and generally only delays the inevitable break up. Again, that's based purely on my observation of the many couples I've known who've gone through it. It could be different for you.
 


	(On the other hand, one--on-one therapy with a good mental health professional can be totally worth it.)
 


	Forget about taking revenge. It's sweet, I know. But you want to get out clean, stay in your kids' lives, and move on. Plotting or taking revenge will destroy that, burn up your headspace, and eat you alive. And that's if everything goes well. Without knowing the details, you're almost certainly dealing with a complex situation that you can't game out accurately. People are unpredictable. And perhaps I've watched one too many true crime shows, but the situation can degrade quickly.
 


	Also, watch the booze. When you're grieving and angry, throwing alcohol in the mix will only make things worse. At best, it promotes melodrama and weight gain. At worst, you'll be acting like a bozo and you could even pick up a bad habit that will alienate your children.
 


	So, put your stuff in line. Act like a responsible, mature, and solid man. Get out as neatly and quickly as you can. That way, you be more likely to preserve your relationship with your children.
 


	And move on to a better chapter in your life.

			I've been pondering this myself over the weekend. [snip]
 


	Gifted with the wealth of those cretins, I would build or buy a Taj Mahal. It would be outfitted with rich silks, tapestries, amazing bathrooms, and, of course, bidets.  I'd have a different bedroom with a different courtesan for each day of the week, and then mix it up depending on my mood. I'd have theme rooms -- Egypt! Decadent Rome!! 1920s Weimar Berlin!! T'ang Dynasty China! Shogunate Japan!! And put the right woman in with the right costumes in each place. I'd have the most gifted musicians playing live music blindfolded, and a rotating harem of beauties across the rainbow. I'd make Louix XV look like a choirboy, is what I'd do. I'd order in a few pallets of oysters and champagne and when than runs out and I need some refreshment, I'd make like a pasha and have ostrich feathered fans waft perfume my way while I studied the outlines of all those perky breasts around me. I'd ask Laetitia and Cinnamon to peel me a few grapes, and then I'd study up on some more variations from the Kama Sutra and Anais Nin to try out. 
 


	Short of that, I'd buy a goddam penthouse suite, pay off the staff, and sweep in whatever lovely or set of lovelies I'd want and hire some clever dude to hide it behind several layers of ownership. And never, ever go into politics.
 


	This is just off the top of my head, you understand. I am basically, a simple fellow with sort of vanilla tastes. But these guys are rich, Rich, RICH. Get it? The set up I'm talking about, prolly worth a little, but you got a hobby, you should take it seriously.
 


	And when they busted my sorry ass, the whole world would at least marvel at just what a decadent motherfucker I was. They sure as shit wouldn't be mocking me in some lame-ass strip mall next to the goddam Godfather's Pizza outlet.
 


	(By the way, I figure if I can figure out how to lavish my generosity on a sweet sex worker in nearly any major city in the world, probably a canny billionaire could too.)

	As other posters have mentioned, it might even be welcomed in the Great Beyond. Maybe it'll be a kind of posthumous tribute that will ease their passage in the bardo.
 


	What I'm wondering is: what about those porn stars who've aged badly. For example, Ginger Lynn. She was a babe. Then she recently made some MILF scenes that are horrific if you compare her MILF self to herself back in the day. When I saw how she looks now, and then fired up an old porno of her ... well, it just reminded me of decay, age and how time defaces everything.  So yeah, I lost interest and felt weird. Luckily, I surfed a bit more and found something good with Bree Olson in it and forgot about the trauma.

			Ahh, c'MON. You guys are missing out on a lot of interesting topics raised here by Mr. 2Big. You're letting your preconceptions about his nature and motives get in the way.
 


	So, I'm wondering:  Are there a lot of --or any -- of you hobbyists creating your own porn to fap to? As a memento? Or a trophy?
 


	If you are, I, for one, applaud your creativity and initiative! But, here's the deal. Even though I am a chiseled and extraordinary example of masculine hunkitude .... I sure as shit don't want to see myself  in the picture or video.  I mean I, like nearly everyone else I know, don't like the sound of my voice. Let alone the sight of my  (amazingly enormous and brass-like) balls wobbling around.  Or even my legendary and marvelous Ivory Tower o' Love. Even if a gorgeous example of beautiful femininity is writhig on good old Mr. Happy and making primal love moans while doing so.
 


	Plus, as a semi-pro photographer, I'd get all distracted by angles and lighting and framing, and, frankly, those are things I don't want to be considering while I am busy doing the Wild Thang. And then, the only angles I could truly find erotic would be with the lovely lady doing reverse cow girl. Still, I wouldn't want to really think about the way my Package of Deelight looks as I thrust manfully and enthusiastically into said goddess. As for porno material, nah, don't think it'd really work for me. In fact, one of the most distracting elements in amateur porn is some chump gasping or breathing heavily and gasping out stuff like, oh baby. 
 


	I don't want to be That Guy.
 


	Don't get me wrong! An attractive woman or women solo or duo: YES! Count me in!!! I will shoot any such erotic material at a seriously discounted rate. But with me in a starring role? It seems way too distracting during the event and a sure boner-killer afterward (despite my ripped and superhero-like physique). And seeing myself in the saddle? It is likely to make me much too self conscious. Anyone ever seen Lilya-4 Ever? It's an early 2000's movie about a Russian girl who ends up hooking in Sweden. There's a montage there of sweaty middle aged dudes that put me off hobbying for, like, oh, a day or two, or so it was so horrific. Flushed sweaty dudes pumping away. It would turn many a man celibate.
 


	But, yes, Mr. 2Big, I have noticed that women are much more likely to share nakey pics. Or wear revealing outfits and not really care if a nipple slips out. We live in marvelous times. And, a propos...I have a friend who's a well-regarded photographer, and nudes are a big part of his work. So, of course, I asked him one day: ""How did you get her [total art babe hottie] to pose for you?""
 


	His answer: ""I asked.""

			For me personally, whenever something does not feel right, I usually back out. Make sure to cancel as far ahead as possible.  Being that this is a favorite of yours, that must make it tough.  Maybe ask is she is willing to speak on that phone just to confirm it is her you are talking to.

There was a listing on P411 I inquired about when there were no pictures on the listing. When I inquired I got pictures from a Robert Privilege.  Anyway, if anyone knows anything please let me know.  Thank you.

			The last woman I saw, I mentioned that I thought her labia was sexy. Maybe an inch long or so. She replied she couldn’t wait to have them shortened. I was surprised. I think, behind innie nipples(or super long and with a small diameter) the labia is soooo erotic. I guess we all find fault with our bodies e.g. a little dunlap disease for me. But in my book, a little length on the labes with innie nipples; well it just don’t get better than that.

			The last woman I saw, I mentioned that I thought her labia was sexy. Maybe an inch long or so. She replied she couldn’t wait to have them shortened. I was surprised. I think, behind innie nipples(or super long and with a small diameter) the labia is soooo erotic. I guess we all find fault with our bodies e.g. a little dunlap disease for me. But in my book, a little length on the labes with innie nipples; well it just don’t get better than that.

			""The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin."" - Ted Kaczynski
 


	This is why these tiny little rebellions against tyranny are important.  The 20th century was littered with examples of how people like me can be affected by people like you when you become too empowered.  At some point, I may no longer have the liberty to keep to myself and heckle humanity from a distance for my own amusement.  Even people like you eventually become victims of your own tyranny when things get bad enough.  Just as he futilely sacrificed his liberty in an attempt to save the world, I'm sacrificing my reputation here to try to enlighten you perverts.  That's not true, I'm doing it for the lulz.  I know I'm not going to get through to anybody.  That's the only difference between the two of us.  I realize you're all doomed and aren't worth saving anyway.  I do enjoy making a joke out of it, though.  To the point that it may be worth the aggravation that humanity caused me before I became too apathetic to care.  I'm quoting and comparing myself to the Unabomber.

			Well you need to hunt around for a newbie friendly provider,  who will accept what you are comfortable giving out. Tell her up front that you need to be able to get a reference from her, to build up your credentials. We all have to start somewhere. Most girls understand this. Read the reviews to look for one. This girl may not be exactly what you are looking for,  but it gets your foot in the door. She might also have a friend who will do the same for you. Then you have two references , with which you can use to see a girl you wanted to see to begin with.

			Cell phones, as long as they are powered up, stay in constant contact with the nearest tower. Even when they are turned off. Yes telecom companies keep this information. Google knows your locations by your internet use. The only way in the past,  was to physically remove the battery from your phone. That solution no longer exists. Removing the sim card does not stop the wifi from searching out networks as you move.  A RF bag is one solution. It blocks your phone from sending or receiving a signal. Now the quality of the bag needs to be factored into your decision. Some are better than others. Just remember you can't be contacted as long as it is sheilded.

			Well New Zealand has an advantage of being off the beaten path and a Island chain to boot. I am sure this helped stop the spread there. 
 


	South Korea  and  Germany started early. Plus I always would see Asians wear  facemasks for years before all this.  
 


	It seems that most of the countries with the most freedoms, got hit the worst.  If US citizens weren't allowed to travel abroad and foreigners where kept from coming here, then we would be better off.  I haven't heard much about North Korea. But that is a price we pay when we are granted these freedoms.  You have to take the bad with the good. If you pray for rain, you have to deal with the mud.

			I do remember years ago a girl working out of a big RV in the KC area.   Though I never met her, the other guys said she would park in big parking lots, at the outer edges.

			It really doesn't matter much to me. As long as you are not being scrutinized by hotel staff or nosey neighbors, that is all I ask. Also that  your vehicle will be ok where you parked it.
 


	 The difference with a place of your own , is  how you can set  the mood. Scented candles, softer sheets,  decor, etc. More like real world dating. I had one girl who worked out of her actual apartment.  Not just one she got for the hobby. She was always running late, even working from home. Lol. We would sit and have a drink and talk first. I got to know her dog. It seemed more like dating. I do miss that.

			No. The hobby is pay for play. So my standards won't change, as long as I am paying for it. I realize  that no matter what, we guys end up paying for it anyway.  In both the real and hobby world.

			Well maybe big business could start testing their employees,  to see if they have had it and recovered. I know they would have to get test kits, but it is somewhere to start. Once enough people get tested and are working, there will be a need for restaurants and bars to take care of them. Air travel for business men . More gasoline for commuting.  Those who are maybe retired or in a high risk category, could stay inside a little longer by choice. 
 


	The thing about  staying shut down long, is business will evolve to work around the issues. At a job site the other day, I saw a vidieo building inspection done. It was only the plumber, but the guy had to do  like a facetime inspection vidieo. I think the inspector was working from his home because of the virus. Without travel time, he can probably do more inspections. So the city might downsize their staff. Other businesses will use technology  to downsize their operations. Maybe more will always work from home. So less building and hiway construction. People without work might never get the same kind of  good paying job back. Or maybe due to age or pre-existing conditions never get a job. So the quicker things start up, the better.

Then, the BIG BOYS in government would most certainly provide bailouts for the big corporations and investors who have been betting on futures.

			Yes, I will be protected - because I will protect myself.  As the economy & society opens, I will continue to be cautious, to follow social distancing guidelines for most interactions.

			Oh something else important - keep in mind that ""Total Cases"" doesn't mean the total number of coronavirus cases that actually exist (in the world or a given country), it means the total number of cases CONFIRMED BY TESTING. So the testing rate, or number of tests per million people, is important, because when the infection rate is high but the testing rate is low, it is likely that many cases are missed.
 


	As of March 9-10, some countries with HIGHER testing rates were:
 


	Bahrain, 4910 per million
 


	South Korea, 4099
 


	Hong Kong, 2134
 


	Italy, 1005
 


	Some countries with LOWER testing rates were:
 


	Japan, 76
 


	Netherlands, 35
 


	United States, 26
 


	Vietnam, 24
 


	Turkey, 10

			ECDC: COVID-19 not containable, set to overwhelm hospitals

	In a stark and urgent COVID-19 risk assessment update today, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that, in a few weeks or even days, other countries in the region may face huge surges that mirror those of China and Italy.
 


	It advised countries to quickly shift to mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable people and prevent overwhelmed hospitals.
 


	Reports of dire conditions in hospitals in Italy's hot spots have been circulating on social media for the past few weeks and are now appearing in medical journal and media reports. The ECDC acknowledges that high numbers of patients needing ventilation have exceeded intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in some healthcare facilities in northern Italy.
 


	Life-and-death decisions in Italy's inundated hospitals



	In a Lancet report today, two authors from Italy said the percentage of COVID-19 patients needing ICU treatment has ranged from 9% to 11% and that ICUs will be at maximum capacity if that trend continues for 1 more week. They predicted that Italy will need 4,000 more ICU beds over the next month, a challenge given that the country has about 5,200 ICU beds.
 


	In the hard-hit Lombardy region, healthcare workers have been working around the clock. About 350 (20%) have been infected, and some have died, according to the report. Italy's government is considering hiring 20,000 more medical workers and providing 5,000 more ventilators. Unless the measures are implemented in the next few days, they wrote, otherwise-avoidable deaths will occur.
 


	""Intensive care specialists are already considering denying life-saving care to the sickest and giving priority to those patients most likely to survive when deciding who to provide ventilation to,"" they wrote. ""In the near future, they will have no choice. They will have to follow the same rules that health-care workers are left with in conflict and disaster zones.""
 


	Countries on track for Hubei scenarios, ECDC warns



	In its assessment today, the ECDC said the risk of severe disease is moderate for the general population but high for older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Increased community transmission may exceed health system capacities in the coming weeks, it said, and countries should act now to step up hospital infection control and surge capacity.
 


	The ECDC said estimates for hospital care suggest that most European countries could reach Hubei province scenarios by the end of March, with all countries reaching that point by mid-April.
 


	The group urged member countries to implement social distancing measures such as cancelling mass gatherings and cordoning off hotspots early to slow outbreaks and give health systems more time to prepare for an influx of patients.
 


	The ECDC also recommended that countries designate COVID-19 facilities to minimize the transmission to other patients and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and identify facilities for managing those with milder symptoms. When resources are stretched or limited, the ECDC said countries should take rational approaches to conserve testing, contact tracing, PPE use, and hospitalization for high-yield situations.
 


	Italy's health ministry today reported 2,651 new cases and 189 more deaths, raising its respective totals to 15,113 cases and 1,016 deaths. Spain's total today rose to 3,126 cases, with the addition of 782 more today. France's total rising to 2,876, with the addition of 595 more. The United Kingdom reported 134 new cases, boosting its total to 590.
 


	Several European countries announced more steps to curb the spread of the virus. For example, Slovakia declared a state of emergency and shut schools and major airports, and the Netherlands banned events of more than 100 people and urged citizens to work from home, if possible.

			Sorry, that number 15 million fatalities is totally wrong, way too high. The estimates I found for deaths from the 2009/2010 H1N1 epidemic are 150,000 to 600,000 worldwide and 9,000 to 18,000 in the United States. And about 10 % to 20 % of the entire world population of 6.8 billion caught the H1N1 flu.
 


	Since 0.68 billion to 1.36 billion people had the illness, and 150,000 to 600,000 died from it, the fatality rate was 0.01% to 0.09 % (or between 1 in 10,000 and 9 in 10,000). The fatality rate of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be 2 %, which is obviously a lot higher.
 


	However, the 2009/2010 pandemic had one unusual / scary feature (compared to typical flu epidemics) - it killed young people a lot more. About 80% of fatalities were under 65 years old, while for typical flu only 20% of the fatalities are under 65.
 


	People with high risk from COVID-19 are described as ""older adults"" (over 60), or with existing chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. Smokers are also at high risk.

			That the ratio of deaths to infections confirmed by testing. Testing is very incomplete so the true rate may be lower. But even if the rate is ""only"" 2%, that's 20 times worse than a flu epidemic, which is really bad (flu kills a lot of people).
 


	Also, some other pre-existing illnesses greatly increase the risk of death. I found the following:
 


	Death rate from COVID-19, depending on pre-existing condition:
 


	+ cardiovascular disease: 10.5 %
 


	+ diabetes: 7.3 %
 


	+ chronic respiratory (lung) disease: 6.3 %
 


	+ high blood pressure: 6.0 %
 


	+ cancer: 5.6 %
 


	no pre-existing serious illness: 0.9 %

			I question some of the above. Death rates from most flu varieties are 0.1 % (1 in 1000) and that hasn't changed in a long time. Also (unfortunately for older people) the death rate from flu, and also from COVID-19, increases rapidly with age above 60.
 


	There was one flu epidemic that was much deadlier - the ""Spanish flu"" of 1918-1919. That had one especially scary aspect - the death rate among young and middle-aged adults was as high as among the elderly. That virus had a mutation that caused it to provoke an extreme over-reaction of the immune system in many people (look up ""cytokine storm"") and the immune over-reaction itself was the cause of death. Fortunately that behavior hasn't been seen again in any viral epidemic since then.
 


	I've read that the worldwide number of deaths from the Spanish flu isn't known because the record-keeping was so poor. Estimates are ""from 17 million to 100 million"". Yikes! That's partly because it occurred at the end of World War I when many governments and nations were on the verge of collapse.
 


	The reason Spanish flu is called Spanish flu is also interesting. It definitely didn't start in Spain. But most European nations were under wartime censorship and their governments simply suppressed news of the epidemic and deaths. In 1918 Spain was not in the war, and had a relatively free press. When the flu reached Spain from France in November 1918, newspapers there were allowed to carry articles about it.

			There are three basic classes of bad reviews I will post:
 


	1) NCNS - I’ve been hasty with these to my own detriment.  Now I allow 24hrs for contact from the YL after the appointment before posting.
 


	2) Ripoff - Cash&Dash, serious Bait&Switch. Significant upsell (Denver Ladies comes to mind). I’m not the stickler some are regarding photos.  If the age and figure are close I tend to let that slide.
 


	3) DANGER!!!  Pimp standing at the door, unhealthy/unclean, substance abuse, outside legal parameters (age, residency, etc)
 


	If a poor session can be attributed to bad chemistry, messy incall, fumbled communications, etc,  I probably won’t review her.

			Agreed!  Once the tech is developed, folks will find other uses.  {sarcasm}For our own benefit of course.  If we’re not doing anything “wrong” there’s no need to worry. {/sarcasm}
 


	However I do like the tech displayed on ‘60 Minutes’ last night being used at one of the auto plants converted to make ventilators (Ford or GM).  Every worker wears a watch which pings when it gets w/in 6’ of another watch.  The two watches exchange IDs for contact mapping. That way if someone gets sick, they know who else to isolate.

			Yes, I will be protected - because I will protect myself.  As the economy & society opens, I will continue to be cautious, to follow social distancing guidelines for most interactions.  Yes, I have the luxury of doing this due to years of hard work.  My ‘job’ these days is to spend what I’ve accumulated over those years - to purchase goods & services, pumping $s into the economy.
 


	I will partially attribute what some may consider a callus attitude to my training.  As a soldier I learned to weigh lives against the greater good.  As an engineer I learned that there are no perfect solutions.

			That’s a decision you’ll have to make. Your risks, not mine.  But I do think you’re “wait & see” attitude is appropriate.   
	Someone said a few weeks ago, “Pump the brakes.”  Whenever we try to restart our economy, it will have to be gradual.  It’s not binary like a switch, more like a rheostat.

	How the War on Sex Work Crushes Underprivileged Women
 


	Maggie McNeill  |  From the March 2020 issue 


	
		That prohibitionist laws are always, always, enforced more heavily upon the poor, the disadvantaged, and minorities is not, I think, controversial. One would have to contort one's brain in a manner worthy of a Cirque du Soleil performance to ignore the facts that cops more heavily patrol poor and minority neighborhoods and actively look for people to arrest; that judges and juries have less sympathy for those they perceive as ""others""; and that, because poor people overwhelmingly lack the resources to mount an adequate criminal defense (or even bail), they are far more likely to plead guilty to whatever a prosecutor offers, just so they can get it over with and at least try to get back to their lives. Protectionist laws (including occupational licensing) similarly harm those who are not yet established in a field, since nonincumbents are less likely to be consulted about the content of those laws and far less likely to be able to afford compliance costs after the regulations take effect. 
	 

	
		These are among the reasons sex workers almost universally prefer prostitution ""decriminalization"" to the regulatory systems characteristic of what is called ""legalization."" The former—unlike so-called drug decriminalization—takes sex work out of the hands of the police altogether, while the latter plants a thicket of special sex-work-specific rules, regulations, laws, licenses, permits, codes, and prohibitions that invariably creates a two-tiered system: one for those who have the money, knowhow, political or business connections, and other resources to comply and thus function ""legally,"" and one for those who do not. In every country with a ""legalized"" system, we see the same pattern: Well-connected businesspeople who have never themselves done sex work buy up all the brothel licenses, while racial or gender minorities, migrants, and other disadvantaged groups are far more likely to be arrested for working illegally within that ""legal"" system—often for violating the same kinds of ridiculous and unnecessary rules that governments love foisting upon industries to which politicians or the cartels who own them have taken a dislike.
	 

	
		Even within the fully criminalized systems typical in the United States, there are glaring disparities of enforcement. Most of y'all reading this probably already know that while white and nonwhite Americans use recreational drugs at roughly equal rates, minorities are arrested more frequently, charged more heavily, and more frequently caged (and for longer terms). And most of y'all can probably guess that it's the same with sex work: While there are sex workers and clients of every description, sex workers of color, trans sex workers, and street workers are dramatically more likely to be hassled, arrested, and even robbed or raped by police than their white, cisgender, and indoor-working counterparts. Black trans street workers, falling into all of these groups, practically have targets painted on their backs; they're often arrested merely for daring to show their faces outdoors, a phenomenon that activists call ""walking while trans."" The same is true for their clients: Poor minority men who can only afford the (generally lower-priced) services of street workers are far more likely to be ensnared by policewomen looking to entrap them into committing a crime than are affluent white men who visit ""high-end"" escorts who discreetly do business in apartments or houses in ""nice"" neighborhoods. In one raid a few years ago, nearly every surname of the men arrested in a ""john sting"" in Seattle was Hispanic, despite the fact that Seattle is, to put it politely, much less ethnically diverse than most U.S. cities.
	 

	
		Just as poverty, minority status, and other disadvantages make people more vulnerable to the predations of police and prosecutors, so too do such attributes expose them to a greater likelihood of exploitation by criminals and unscrupulous businesspeople who don't quite qualify as criminals (but are bad enough). Disadvantaged sex workers face a greater likelihood of violence from people—whether law enforcement or civilian sexual predators—posing as clients. And they usually lack the resources to set themselves up as indoor escorts, which requires things like professional photos, quality lingerie, a professional-looking website, advertising, beauty treatments, the rent for an ""incall"" location in a neighborhood wealthier men won't be afraid to visit, the cost of a dependable car for doing ""outcalls""—I could go on, but I suspect you get the picture.
	 

	
		It shouldn't be surprising that, in desperation, some women will become involved with smooth-talking boyfriends or other middlemen who promise to help them access those things and thereby move off the street into a safer mode of work. But often, the boyfriend is a liar, or the middleman wants more money or more control than the sex worker anticipated, and before she knows it she finds herself in an exploitative or abusive situation. Both the frequency and the severity of such situations have been outrageously exaggerated by moralists, who liberally bandy about the label ""sex trafficking,"" who characterize the workers involved as passive victims rather than rational actors trying to do the best they can with very limited options, and who pretend that exploitation is the norm in our trade rather than an outlier (and an occurrence that would be even less common in the absence of prohibition). Nonetheless, as you can imagine, these situations are more common among poor women, migrants, underage sex workers, and so on.
	 

	
		The artificial hysteria around ""sex trafficking"" has made it an effective excuse for any oppressive law the government wants to pass, beginning with more money for cops and expanding into mass surveillance, greater restrictions on women's movement in public, and—perhaps most pernicious of all—internet censorship.
	 

	
		In March 2018, Congress passed a legislative package colloquially known as FOSTA-SESTA and formally known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. Even before President Donald Trump signed it into law a few weeks later, it had done tremendous damage to the sex work ecosystem.
	 

	
		The law makes a web platform liable for ""facilitating prostitution"" and ""sex trafficking"" (neither of which it defines adequately) if someone uses it to advertise illegal services. The chilling effect was dramatic; the majority of sites frequented by sex workers immediately shut down, closed themselves off to U.S. visitors, enacted draconian censorship policies, or—if the site's entire business model was based in sex work advertising, as with industry leader Eros.com—established a series of continually changing, increasingly incomprehensible, and confusingly silly rules about the types of pictures, links, and words that would be allowed. At about the same time, the feds shut down Backpage, the colossus of inexpensive sex work ads; its former owners have been subjected to a campaign of persecution that has not yet run its course.
	 

	
		Almost overnight, the industry was thrown into chaos worldwide. Although it was founded by Americans, Backpage was popular in Australia and many other places where prostitution is legal to one degree or another. Sex workers in those countries were forced to scramble for new ways to advertise their services. In some cases, they opted to build their own websites, domiciled and hosted in countries beyond the reach of American puritanism.
	 

	
		In the United States, the consequences have been nothing less than catastrophic. Many disadvantaged sex workers were forced to return to street work. Some younger women who had never worked without online ads were pushed to the street for the first time, placing them in far greater danger than either their indoor-working sisters or the older outdoor workers who at least knew what to expect. Naturally, ""not in my backyard"" (NIMBY) interests reacted badly to the increasing number of street workers, and many police departments have responded with more raids and arrests on popular strolls.
	 

	
		Other U.S. sex workers were able to scrape together the resources to move to more expensive ad sites, such as the aforementioned Eros. But the personal information that platform now demands that advertisers share—scans of a photo ID with legal name clearly displayed, full-face photos in the same outfits used in face-blurred ad shots, etc.—have become so terrifyingly invasive that many established escorts, myself included, have abandoned it on the theory that the company may be amassing data to offer as a bargaining chip when the feds come after it, as the Department of Justice has already indicated it will.
	 

	
		Even those who have succeeded in moving into more ""upscale"" forms of work have a big problem: In recent years, U.S. law enforcement agencies have been adopting the faux-feminist ""end demand"" model of prohibition, which involves prosecuting clients more heavily than sex workers. A goal of this strategy is to win the support of carceral feminists who can't or won't comprehend that attacking a business's clients is an attack on the business, regardless of rhetoric.
	 

	
		The shift has understandably made potential clients much warier that the ""escort"" behind an ad might actually be a gang of cops out to ruin their lives—and that in turn has made many men more reluctant to provide the personal information that sex workers use to screen potential customers. Of course, established providers will generally have a considerable online footprint (ratings and reviews, a blog or Twitter account, a personal website, videos, searchable pictures—even articles in libertarian magazines!) that would-be clients can examine to help them be sure a sex worker is the real McCoy and not a trap. More mature ladies also generally have a healthy number of regular clients built up over years. I'll be just fine, for example—and every time I'm quoted in an interview or appear in a documentary, I get more requests for dates.
	 

	
		You know who isn't likely to have such an unmistakably real internet presence? Those who are trying to move indoors from the street. Those who used to take out cheap Backpage ads and don't have their own professional websites. Part-timers who can't be too conspicuous about their side hustle for fear of losing their day jobs (or their kids). Those who were new to the industry when FOSTA-SESTA hit. 
	 

	
		In short, the disadvantaged. And so, as is always the case, the effects of prohibition and policing fall most heavily on those members of society who already suffer far more than their share of misfortune and violence.

			There are three basic classes of bad reviews I will post:
 


	1) NCNS - I’ve been hasty with these to my own detriment.  Now I allow 24hrs for contact from the YL after the appointment before posting.
 


	2) Ripoff - Cash&Dash, serious Bait&Switch. Significant upsell (Denver Ladies comes to mind). I’m not the stickler some are regarding photos.  If the age and figure are close I tend to let that slide.
 


	3) DANGER!!!  Pimp standing at the door, unhealthy/unclean, substance abuse, outside legal parameters (age, residency, etc)
 


	If a poor session can be attributed to bad chemistry, messy incall, fumbled communications, etc,  I probably won’t review her.

			Yes, I will be protected - because I will protect myself.  As the economy & society opens, I will continue to be cautious, to follow social distancing guidelines for most interactions.  Yes, I have the luxury of doing this due to years of hard work.  My ‘job’ these days is to spend what I’ve accumulated over those years - to purchase goods & services, pumping $s into the economy.
 


	I will partially attribute what some may consider a callus attitude to my training.  As a soldier I learned to weigh lives against the greater good.  As an engineer I learned that there are no perfect solutions.

			The last woman I saw, I mentioned that I thought her labia was sexy. Maybe an inch long or so. She replied she couldn’t wait to have them shortened. I was surprised. I think, behind innie nipples(or super long and with a small diameter) the labia is soooo erotic. I guess we all find fault with our bodies e.g. a little dunlap disease for me. But in my book, a little length on the labes with innie nipples; well it just don’t get better than that.

			I travel to China several times a year on business.  About the only real safe places now to try and meet escorts is in the upscale hotels.....easy to find companionship with bartenders that will hook you up. I strongly suggest avoiding any other venues to find escorts or activities including the salons and massage parlors. Things are really changing over there with many things and not for the good either. It’s getting very dangerous for Westerners in my opinion. I tried to give this same advice to someone I know recently but he ignored the tips. He was robbed at knifepoint in Shanghai and got a pretty good beating afterwards.

			So yesterday I made an appointment with a provider that has all yes references with good comments. Great communication but upon getting there she is running late and offers a friend which I decline and decide to wait for her. No problem at all on my end as things happen as well all know. Anyway......as I am waiting from a very tactical position, 2 Sheriff SUV's move into the lot and I am out of there telling the provider what's going on.  Driving off another Sheriff car was headed down the road towards the incall. Quite fast I'd add  
 


	I am not saying it was related to this provider but I got to wondering about the whole incident. When I got home I did a Google search of the number and it pulled up multiple listings (yea I should've checked that prior). I guess if I had a giant set of balls I would've walked on in Lol.

			It’s not just the grandpas in the race for president. All the political leadership in this country would fit right in at the local retirement home.
 


	Nancy Pelosi — 79, soon to be 80 in a couple of weeks.
 


	Mitch McConnell — 79.
 


	Average age of the Senate: 61 — One of the oldest in US History.
 


	Average age of the Supreme Court by the next election: 75.
 


	As someone who’s aging like fine wine, I think it’s short sighted to shove older people aside as relics. I generally like the generation of people in their 70s and 80s, But I still gotta say my father wasn’t the same man at 76 as he was at 66. I am not the guy I was at 25 or 35. 
 


	That the entire leadership class of this country could be wearing Depends under those nice suits speaks to a level of corruption and stagnation that’s part of our problems, no matter which side of the aisle you sit on.
 


	For comparison 
 


	Boris Johnson, UK Prime Minister: 55 
 


	Emmanuel Macron, French Prime Minister: 42 (he won the election at when he was 39)
 


	Katrin Jakobsdottir, Iceland, 43
 


	Sanna Marin, head of Finland (and pretty hot!) 34
 


	Whatever the problems those countries have — and they have some—at least they have flexible democracies with some fresh blood coming in.

			So far, Covid19 has killed about 3,000 globally. Certainly, more people will die — mostly the aged and those with compromised immune systems. For perspective,  80,000 Americans died last year from plain old influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
 


	Cars kill 36,000 people every year. And yet, we still drive on I25 or I70 in search of love or pussy. And that’s some dangerous action, right there. We all balance risk and reward according to what we want.
 


	Apart from a few seniors and hypochondriacs, I’m not sure there’ll be a big hit to the hobby. I could be wrong. But I also remember the SARS hysteria, and while that was a big deal in Asia, in Colorado...not so much. At all.

			Good questions. But it's considered bad form to ask about specific places on the public boards. That could attract the attention of law enforcement, and make those establishments the target of a bust.
 


	That said, they look like AMPs (asian massage parlors). Not all AMPs offer happy endings or, uh, total relaxation. (Which is why you probably asked, I know.) The subject of AMPs comes up frequently in the forums. You can probably find some good general information.  For massage parlors, Rubmaps.ch is a fee-based web site that offers consumer reviews. You can also find out if a place or a specific masseuse offers more than a standard rub. One poster here suggested getting a one-month membership to Rubmaps, researching all the places you'd be interested in visiting, then cancelling your membership.
 


	From what I've read:
 


	In general, you'll show up at the door. Either the mama-san or a masseuse will answer and ask you how long you want. You'll be led to a small room with a table. If you are asked if you've been there before, answer yes. It's a screener question to see if you might be interested in a hand job or whatever. Strip totally. That will also signal that you're open to Other Services. Put a tip on the table or in an obvious place. I don't really know how much to tip. It should be at least the door fee. If you tip double the door, that'll make the masseuse really happy, but it might be overkill. The masseuse will either pretend to give you a massage or actually give you one as you're face down. 
 


	She might initiate some more intimate moves. Then she'll ask you to flip over. You can indicate with a gesture or a look what you'd like. She may ask you in a whisper. She may upsell.
 


	Your experiences can vary widely, even in the same parlor. 
 


	According to knowledgable sources, the women are generally going to be middle aged. Sometimes, they will be middle aged and kind of cute or, even more exceptionally, youngish and cute, but it's almost never that you'll see a 7 or above (to be crass). It can happen, though. Some Korean places in Denver years ago had some attractive workers. But whoever it is, it will never be the cutie in the ad. Also, they don't speak English very well. 
 


	Also, keep in mind that many fine women offer FBSM in the Boulder area as independent workers.

			Thanks NoCoGeezer for bringing back a lot of good memories. You are correct, there was a rub n tug place on Canyon, just up from the courthouse. That made me a little nervous when I was exiting the place. I'd bet a lot of attorneys and their clients got some high quality stress relief there.
 


	There was indeed a brothel on north Broadway; it's now a Subaru repair shop. Very pretty ladies worked there as well.
 


	There used to be a hotel up on Broadway with hot tubs in the back of the rooms. It was real fun to drop some MDMA, look at the stars and hang with my girlfriend at the time, a stripper from the Colorado Mining Company. Pre AIDS. Pre herpes. You youngins have no idea. 
 


	I've been missing the Bustop for a while now. Construction has been underway for another architectural shit box where it used to be. I remember many fine nights there. The women were friendly and chatty, not totally about the hustle, and the drinks didn't cost much, for a strip club. Kinda like Friends, only with tits and ass. As another poster mentioned, you could get pretty lucky there. A lot of smart, adventurous women worked that stage.
 


	Nitro is way more upscale, and the girls work ya pretty hard. The entertainers are all quite beautiful, though.  Some guy a while back posted about getting lucky with a dancer, so maybe I've been there on off-nights. Also, having the dancers at eye-level feels weird to me. But, not at all the same vibe. Still, the owners played a great game getting that place in town.
 


	The last time I went to the Bustop, a hot entertainer seemed clearly, and so sincerely into me. That is, until I told her I didn't actually want to be her sugardaddy if that only meant holding her bags at the Cherry Creek Mall while she went shopping with my credit card. 
 


	Age. It happens.
 


	RIP Bustop.

			You might find this useful:
 


	http://www.internationalsexguide.nl/forum/forum.php
 


	I can't verify how solid the information is, since I don't travel internationally very often now. Still, you can get a pretty reasonable overview of the lay of the land.
 


	I'd have to echo the advice about either not hobbying in China at all or taking time and building a relationships with some gatekeepers over a long period. The few people I know who have worked in China and who hobby usually did the fun stuff in Hong Kong or Bangkok or other big Asian cities -- not in China itself. The government has been cracking down on so-called vice activities overall. 
 


	Personally, I've had very mixed experiences internationally -- great and horrific -- and those were in Western countries with tolerant regimes. Even then, the ripoffs and danger is high -- part of the excitement, but also awful when things don't work out (I'm still pissed about a 400 euro self-service job, and no, don't ask because I'm not going to say any more about that). (And I'm not actually a total idiot, believe it or not). These were in places with very low linguistic barriers -- nothing like dealing with ideograms and Mandarin. As you'd guess in a huge country emerging from poverty, there are a lot of very sharp hustlers. If it were utterly corrupt, like some other countries, you'd probably be better off, but China's in the worst between zone -- corrupt, but also with puritanical government crackdowns.
 


	You probably know this, too, but all of your Internet activity will be tracked, as well as your phone calls. You should assume any electronic activity you engage in will be documented by the authorities.
 


	Also, China's government is an absolutely evil totalitarian regime. If you want some confirmation, google ""Uigur"" or consider what's happening in Tibet, let alone the violence in Hong Kong. The people can be great, but the system is one of the very worst on the planet.

			Very cool link, thank you for posting. The women really own themselves in most of the images.
 


	I recently read Charlie Chaplin's memoir, and a criminal's memoirs, You Just Can't Win. Both of them described whole city blocks given over dozens of brothels, dance halls and bars in any sizable town around the turn of the last century. Charlie Chaplin said Denver's was particularly good, and Kansas City boasted a huge red light district larger than many small towns. It made the chief of police a wealthy fellow, with all the bribes and payoffs.
 


	Also cool about brothels: jazz.
 


	I've had good experiences in brothels, generally. In Denver, the old 'hot tub' places functioned as brothels. That was fun. Then the Caucasian massage parlors in the early 80s were effectively cat houses. Many of the workers were very attractive, and you could easily find someone you vibed with out of a crew of eight or so. 
 


	Supposedly, this is the menu of a New Orleans brothel. It looks authentic, anyway. If it is, it proves great grandpa was as kinky, or kinkier, than you.

			Glory holes were a relatively common part of gay subculture, pre-AIDS.
 


	Back in olden times, I was interested in the seedy side of life. On a trip to San Francisco back in the early 80s -- pre-AIDS and pre-herpes scare -- I ended up in a porno palace not far from the Tenderloin. It was a kind of Dave and Busters for sex -- arcades, girls behind glass, a strip club, a porn shop. Next door to the pleasure palace was an unmarked door.
 


	Had to be good, right?
 


	Behind the door was a junky gate keeper who took money for the glory hole in the back of the shop. He had to explain the concept to me. He also swore there were females on the other side of the holes.
 


	I bailed, for a lot of reasons -- the vibe there was heavy and dark, literally and figuratively. The idea of sticking Mr. Happy through a gap into a random person's mouth creeped me out -- even when I was a complete moron as well as high and horny.  I had visions of a legless, toothless hag working on my knob, and split.
 


	(Now, that was that place and that time.  If consenting people of whatever gender and however they identify want to indulge, go for it. It's not my business.)
 


	Not long afterwards, the topic came up again --- I used to work in a profession that's popular with gay men. They talked about glory holes (along with bath houses and the rest of it.) Glory holes were a fairly common thing, I guess, and available in some of the more radical gay clubs both informally and officially. (So this is hearsay, because I don't have any direct experience of this).
 


	He'd also confirmed what Mr 2 Big has noted -- they're always dudes on the other side. No matter what the advertising.
 


	I also remember those arcade booths with the holes punched in the walls. And, man, that's one thing I don't miss about those pre-VHS, pre-DVD days. It seemed as if every time I wanted to drop a slug to watch Seka get it on in 8mm technicolor glory  there was some guy in the next booth begging to blow me. (Again, consulting adults, blah blah, but .... thank you, nah.)

			And, of COURSE I made a stupid error when I posted: the sentence should read: ...""I generally dislike people who use errors in and and syntax to criticize a person...""
 


	Which is another reason why I avoid criticizing other people's grammar and typos -- because it almost always means I post a dumb shit error myself. Damn.

			Well, you could savor the delicious irony of someone complaining about how he or she is smarter than everyone else while expressing that thought in atrocious grammar and syntax.
 


	So, you could spend your extra time learning English grammar. Or, you could take an extra minute or so to look over what you've typed and correct obvious errors.
 


	Now, personally speaking, I am not so smart. In fact, I'm rather stupid. What I have noticed about people smarter than I am is that they are curious. About ideas, books, countries, cultures, history, science, mathematics and -- a lot of the time -- they are curious about other people. Even idiots like me.
 


	I'd suggest you put that high-powered intellect of yours into trying to understand the people you encounter. What motivates them? Why? What influences shaped their view of life? What is their view of life? It'd be actually worthwhile to understand what a moron -- like me, for example -- thinks about the nature and purpose of things, so you could avoid the same snares.
 


	The other thing I've noticed about the people that are much smarter than I, is that they're rarely bored. So you could learn a foreign language, study physics, volunteer for a literacy program to teach people who can't even read or write a few necessary skills. You could avoid humanity altogether and learn Classical Greek and Latin, look for a cure for cancer ... the possibilities are really endless.
 


	(And, just so you know, I generally dislike people who use errors in grammar and syntax of person who posted in a forum, but, in your case, I made an exception. And if English is a second language, then, bravo for learning it up to a certain point. But maybe you should learn it a tad bit better.)
 


	Good luck to you, and I hope you can bear that painful burden well as you go through the rest of your life.

			You should print out jj254-1's advice and follow it to the t. It's one of the best pieces of counsel I've read on this board.
 


	Turn the page. Move on. Get your shit together. Figure out what you want to rescue from the burning house that is your marriage.
 


	She betrayed you. No amount of counseling and conversations will change that. If you can accept that, forgive her completely,  and trust her from now on, then, yeah, sure. Stay with her. Let the Vatican know, too, because you will be in line for sainthood.
 


	You could try marital counseling. In my experience, that usually amounts to the female therapist and the female spouse agreeing that the male in the relationship has issues that he needs to work on. It's also expensive, takes a lot of time and work, and generally only delays the inevitable break up. Again, that's based purely on my observation of the many couples I've known who've gone through it. It could be different for you.
 


	(On the other hand, one--on-one therapy with a good mental health professional can be totally worth it.)
 


	Forget about taking revenge. It's sweet, I know. But you want to get out clean, stay in your kids' lives, and move on. Plotting or taking revenge will destroy that, burn up your headspace, and eat you alive. And that's if everything goes well. Without knowing the details, you're almost certainly dealing with a complex situation that you can't game out accurately. People are unpredictable. And perhaps I've watched one too many true crime shows, but the situation can degrade quickly.
 


	Also, watch the booze. When you're grieving and angry, throwing alcohol in the mix will only make things worse. At best, it promotes melodrama and weight gain. At worst, you'll be acting like a bozo and you could even pick up a bad habit that will alienate your children.
 


	So, put your stuff in line. Act like a responsible, mature, and solid man. Get out as neatly and quickly as you can. That way, you be more likely to preserve your relationship with your children.
 


	And move on to a better chapter in your life.

			I've been pondering this myself over the weekend. [snip]
 


	Gifted with the wealth of those cretins, I would build or buy a Taj Mahal. It would be outfitted with rich silks, tapestries, amazing bathrooms, and, of course, bidets.  I'd have a different bedroom with a different courtesan for each day of the week, and then mix it up depending on my mood. I'd have theme rooms -- Egypt! Decadent Rome!! 1920s Weimar Berlin!! T'ang Dynasty China! Shogunate Japan!! And put the right woman in with the right costumes in each place. I'd have the most gifted musicians playing live music blindfolded, and a rotating harem of beauties across the rainbow. I'd make Louix XV look like a choirboy, is what I'd do. I'd order in a few pallets of oysters and champagne and when than runs out and I need some refreshment, I'd make like a pasha and have ostrich feathered fans waft perfume my way while I studied the outlines of all those perky breasts around me. I'd ask Laetitia and Cinnamon to peel me a few grapes, and then I'd study up on some more variations from the Kama Sutra and Anais Nin to try out. 
 


	Short of that, I'd buy a goddam penthouse suite, pay off the staff, and sweep in whatever lovely or set of lovelies I'd want and hire some clever dude to hide it behind several layers of ownership. And never, ever go into politics.
 


	This is just off the top of my head, you understand. I am basically, a simple fellow with sort of vanilla tastes. But these guys are rich, Rich, RICH. Get it? The set up I'm talking about, prolly worth a little, but you got a hobby, you should take it seriously.
 


	And when they busted my sorry ass, the whole world would at least marvel at just what a decadent motherfucker I was. They sure as shit wouldn't be mocking me in some lame-ass strip mall next to the goddam Godfather's Pizza outlet.
 


	(By the way, I figure if I can figure out how to lavish my generosity on a sweet sex worker in nearly any major city in the world, probably a canny billionaire could too.)

			Nope. I wouldn't worry about fapping to those who've passed on. 
 


	As other posters have mentioned, it might even be welcomed in the Great Beyond. Maybe it'll be a kind of posthumous tribute that will ease their passage in the bardo.
 


	What I'm wondering is: what about those porn stars who've aged badly. For example, Ginger Lynn. She was a babe. Then she recently made some MILF scenes that are horrific if you compare her MILF self to herself back in the day. When I saw how she looks now, and then fired up an old porno of her ... well, it just reminded me of decay, age and how time defaces everything.  So yeah, I lost interest and felt weird. Luckily, I surfed a bit more and found something good with Bree Olson in it and forgot about the trauma.

			Ahh, c'MON. You guys are missing out on a lot of interesting topics raised here by Mr. 2Big. You're letting your preconceptions about his nature and motives get in the way.
 


	So, I'm wondering:  Are there a lot of --or any -- of you hobbyists creating your own porn to fap to? As a memento? Or a trophy?
 


	If you are, I, for one, applaud your creativity and initiative! But, here's the deal. Even though I am a chiseled and extraordinary example of masculine hunkitude .... I sure as shit don't want to see myself  in the picture or video.  I mean I, like nearly everyone else I know, don't like the sound of my voice. Let alone the sight of my  (amazingly enormous and brass-like) balls wobbling around.  Or even my legendary and marvelous Ivory Tower o' Love. Even if a gorgeous example of beautiful femininity is writhig on good old Mr. Happy and making primal love moans while doing so.
 


	Plus, as a semi-pro photographer, I'd get all distracted by angles and lighting and framing, and, frankly, those are things I don't want to be considering while I am busy doing the Wild Thang. And then, the only angles I could truly find erotic would be with the lovely lady doing reverse cow girl. Still, I wouldn't want to really think about the way my Package of Deelight looks as I thrust manfully and enthusiastically into said goddess. As for porno material, nah, don't think it'd really work for me. In fact, one of the most distracting elements in amateur porn is some chump gasping or breathing heavily and gasping out stuff like, oh baby. 
 


	I don't want to be That Guy.
 


	Don't get me wrong! An attractive woman or women solo or duo: YES! Count me in!!! I will shoot any such erotic material at a seriously discounted rate. But with me in a starring role? It seems way too distracting during the event and a sure boner-killer afterward (despite my ripped and superhero-like physique). And seeing myself in the saddle? It is likely to make me much too self conscious. Anyone ever seen Lilya-4 Ever? It's an early 2000's movie about a Russian girl who ends up hooking in Sweden. There's a montage there of sweaty middle aged dudes that put me off hobbying for, like, oh, a day or two, or so it was so horrific. Flushed sweaty dudes pumping away. It would turn many a man celibate.
 


	But, yes, Mr. 2Big, I have noticed that women are much more likely to share nakey pics. Or wear revealing outfits and not really care if a nipple slips out. We live in marvelous times. And, a propos...I have a friend who's a well-regarded photographer, and nudes are a big part of his work. So, of course, I asked him one day: ""How did you get her [total art babe hottie] to pose for you?""
 


	His answer: ""I asked.""

Please find that person who is in you life and get involved. Make sure they know someone cares and make sure they have something to look forward to.

			""The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin."" - Ted Kaczynski
 


	This is why these tiny little rebellions against tyranny are important.  The 20th century was littered with examples of how people like me can be affected by people like you when you become too empowered.  At some point, I may no longer have the liberty to keep to myself and heckle humanity from a distance for my own amusement.  Even people like you eventually become victims of your own tyranny when things get bad enough.  Just as he futilely sacrificed his liberty in an attempt to save the world, I'm sacrificing my reputation here to try to enlighten you perverts.  That's not true, I'm doing it for the lulz.  I know I'm not going to get through to anybody.  That's the only difference between the two of us.  I realize you're all doomed and aren't worth saving anyway.  I do enjoy making a joke out of it, though.  To the point that it may be worth the aggravation that humanity caused me before I became too apathetic to care.  I'm quoting and comparing myself to the Unabomber.

I think, behind innie nipples(or super long and with a small diameter) the labia is soooo erotic. I guess we all find fault with our bodies e.g. a little dunlap disease for me. But in my book, a little length on the labes with innie nipples; well it just don’t get better than that.

			Well you need to hunt around for a newbie friendly provider,  who will accept what you are comfortable giving out. Tell her up front that you need to be able to get a reference from her, to build up your credentials. We all have to start somewhere. Most girls understand this. Read the reviews to look for one. This girl may not be exactly what you are looking for,  but it gets your foot in the door. She might also have a friend who will do the same for you. Then you have two references , with which you can use to see a girl you wanted to see to begin with.

			Cell phones, as long as they are powered up, stay in constant contact with the nearest tower. Even when they are turned off. Yes telecom companies keep this information. Google knows your locations by your internet use. The only way in the past,  was to physically remove the battery from your phone. That solution no longer exists. Removing the sim card does not stop the wifi from searching out networks as you move.  A RF bag is one solution. It blocks your phone from sending or receiving a signal. Now the quality of the bag needs to be factored into your decision. Some are better than others. Just remember you can't be contacted as long as it is sheilded.

	 The difference with a place of your own , is  how you can set  the mood. Scented candles, softer sheets,  decor, etc. More like real world dating. I had one girl who worked out of her actual apartment.  Not just one she got for the hobby. She was always running late, even working from home. Lol. We would sit and have a drink and talk first.

			Well maybe big business could start testing their employees,  to see if they have had it and recovered. I know they would have to get test kits, but it is somewhere to start. Once enough people get tested and are working, there will be a need for restaurants and bars to take care of them. Air travel for business men . More gasoline for commuting.  Those who are maybe retired or in a high risk category, could stay inside a little longer by choice. 
 


	The thing about  staying shut down long, is business will evolve to work around the issues. At a job site the other day, I saw a vidieo building inspection done. It was only the plumber, but the guy had to do  like a facetime inspection vidieo. I think the inspector was working from his home because of the virus. Without travel time, he can probably do more inspections. So the city might downsize their staff. Other businesses will use technology  to downsize their operations. Maybe more will always work from home. So less building and hiway construction. People without work might never get the same kind of  good paying job back. Or maybe due to age or pre-existing conditions never get a job. So the quicker things start up, the better.

			i imagine hotels are a bit risky given that instead of a few rooms available they have only a few rooms filled and see a whole lot more of the cummings and goings all seemingly about an hour long:)

			i just wish they could figure out the testing component and have everyone tested. 
 


	it seems (to me) that our collective smart people should be able to figure out testing - and then if congress passed a 'test everyone' component in a stimulus bill we would get to the better side of this a whole lot faster...
 


	so much unknown in this 'effort'...
